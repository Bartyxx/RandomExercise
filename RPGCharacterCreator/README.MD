<h1>RPG Character Creator</h1>

This program creates a Character for an RPG game. Through two questions the character is created with stats and a name.<br/>


The questions are two:<br/>
<b>Do you evaluate more physical strength, agility or intellectual power?</b><br/>
The possible answers are three:<br/>
s --> strenght<br/>
a --> agility<br/>
i --> intellectual power<br/>

<b>In what do you identify? Male, Female or Other?</b><br/>
The possible answers are three:<br/>
m --> male<br/>
f --> female<br/>
o --> other<br/>

Considering the option chosen by the users the PG is created.<br/>

The name of the character is created randomly.<br/>

After that, the statistics of the character are saved in a file with the name of the character randomly generated and used as file name. <br/>
