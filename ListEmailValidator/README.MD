<h1>List Email Validator</h1>

This program checks if the emails in a list are correct.<br/>
Correct means that the hypothetical mails are composed of all the parts of a mail. The program doesn't check if the mail is active or fake, only if the string contains all the parts of an email.<br/>

The list of mail is taken from a .csv file and the output is a .txt file with two columns:<br/>
- <b>Email</b>  --> The mail taken from the .csv file.<br/>
- <b>Status</b> --> Correct or Wrong.
